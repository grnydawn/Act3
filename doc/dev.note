1. classfication tree
- split a large order into smaller order
- a leaf order is configured with stochastic parameters that can be optimized through machine learning
- each branches from upper node to lower nodes requires decision-making information to decied which branch will be chosen. The information is provided from analysis part.

2. Analysis part
- analysis part generates information required for decision making of branch seletions and/or a leaf node execution
- The list of information can be automatically collected from classfication tree
- analysis can be executed through probing tasks 

3. optimizations
- mutiple leaf order may be executed in parallel to remove dependancy between them
- once a leaf order wins against other leaf nodes, it will combines other optimizations through combinatorial merge.
- This optimizaion repeats from the start of analysis to optimize further, 


4. knowledge accumulation
- how to generate better classification
- how to improve all the decision ...
- how to match input information to leaf order to optimized distribution of parameters of the leaf node
