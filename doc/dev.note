1. classfication tree
- split a large order into smaller order
- a leaf order is configured with stochastic parameters that can be optimized through machine learning
- each branches from upper node to lower nodes requires decision-making information to decied which branch will be chosen. The information is provided from analysis part.

2. Analysis part
- analysis part generates information required for decision making of branch seletions and/or a leaf node execution
- The list of information can be automatically collected from classfication tree
- analysis can be executed through probing tasks 

3. optimizations
- mutiple leaf order may be executed in parallel to remove dependancy between them
- once a leaf order wins against other leaf nodes, it will combines other optimizations through combinatorial merge.
- This optimizaion repeats from the start of analysis to optimize further, 


4. knowledge accumulation
- how to generate better classification
- how to improve all the decision ...
- how to match input information to leaf order to optimized distribution of parameters of the leaf node


causal relation ship notes
1. Inductive reasoning provides us with a way to think without logical error
2. However, inductive reasoning can only reason about what we already know
3. Deductive reasoning can reason about cause of outcome, which enables us to enlarge our knowledge base
4. However deductive reasoning is based on a causal relationship model which is essentially not perfect model
5. Now, the qestion is how we can update model in corrrect direction if we have input-output data
6. All-to-all relationship??? Everything is connected?
